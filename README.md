# Security-Audit

Initial Commit 2-11-2025

The purpose of the Security Audit (Cyber Audit) python3 script is to automate the collection, analysis, and reporting on home network security posture. Developed for potential use as a service provided by Florida Web Architects LLC and released open source for the home/commercial use of others.

Our goal is to be able to build out a completely automated reporting system for home cyber security posture analysis, potentially even branching into use in the commercial space.
